#  Auxiliary Project 1 - Shell Scripting
Create file named names.csv and populate with first names of users to be onboarded by editing with a text editor and inserting one name per line.
Create a shell script named onboard.sh and have it do the following:
-----------------------------------------------------

# Read a CSV file that contains 20 new Linux users.
# Create each user on the server and add to an existing group called 'Developers'.
# Check for the existence of the user on the system, before attempting to create new user.
# The user that is being created also must also have a default home folder
# Each user should have a .ssh folder within its HOME folder. If it does not exist, then it will be created.
# For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, create an authorized_keys file and add the public key provided for project.

----------------------------------------------------
## Create ec2 instance ## 
Copy onboard.sh and names.csv to server
`scp -i private_key.pem onboarding.sh user@ip-address:~/;`
